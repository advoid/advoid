# advoid

A software for making an Adblocker based on DNS blacklisting and optionally webfilter using a Proxy

Originally advoid was designed to make an adblock device using an Raspberry Pi. This will still be possible but the software will be natively useable on any server device. Mostly this is a set of scripts for setting things up properly. It will still be possible to turn any Raspberry Pi device into an advoid adblocker without any problems. And of cource there will be prebuilt images for creating an SD card for your Pi without any configuration...

More details will follow next.
